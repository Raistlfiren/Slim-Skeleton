# Slim Framework 3 Skeleton Application

This is a fork of [slimphp/Slim-Skeleton](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Skeleton) with some small changes (codestyle, directory structure, dependencies).

**New Dependencies**

## Install the Application

Run this command from the directory in which you want to install your new Slim Framework application.

    php composer.phar create-project Raistlfiren/slim-skeleton [my-app-name]

Replace `[my-app-name]` with the desired directory name for your new application. You'll want to:

* Point your virtual host document root to your new application's `web/` directory.
* Ensure `logs/` is web writeable.

That's it! Now go build something cool.
